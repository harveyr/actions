# actions

This is a listing of my Github Actions so my team(s) and I can keep track of them. If you aren't on a team with me, use these at your peril! :D

## Github Actions


### Changed Files in Branch

https://github.com/harveyr/gh-action-changed-files-in-branch

Outputs a list of files that have changed in your branch compared to a base branch.

### Deps Image Action

https://github.com/harveyr/gh-action-deps-image

Action to help you publish a "deps" docker imageâ€”an image with your app's dependencies installed. You can use that image to layer your source code on top of. 

Note: At the moment, this action doesn't really do anything. Just playing around.

### ESLint Action

Run ESLint and report GitHub annotations.
